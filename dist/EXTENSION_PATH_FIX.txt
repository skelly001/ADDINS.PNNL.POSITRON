EXTENSION PATH QUOTING FIX
==========================

Issue: "sandbox-sync is not recognized as an internal or external command"

Cause:
------
The extension wasn't properly quoting paths that contain spaces when executing
the sandbox-sync binary. This affected:
- Binary path (e.g., "C:/Users/.../ADDINS.PNNL.VSC/bin/sandbox-sync-windows-x64.exe")
- Scripts path (e.g., "C:/Users/.../r_script_sandbox")
- Data path (e.g., "C:/Users/.../OneDrive - PNNL/Documents/data_sandbox")

The path "OneDrive - PNNL" contains spaces, which caused Windows to interpret
the command incorrectly.

Fix:
----
Updated extension.ts to automatically quote any paths containing spaces:

```typescript
const quotePath = (p: string): string => {
    if (p.includes(' ')) {
        return `"${p}"`;
    }
    return p;
};
```

This applies to:
- syncBinaryPath
- scriptsPath
- dataPath
- exclude patterns

What You Need to Do:
--------------------
1. Uninstall the old extension in Positron:
   - Extensions view → Right-click "Sandbox Switcher" → Uninstall

2. Reload Positron:
   - Ctrl+Shift+P → "Developer: Reload Window"

3. Install the new VSIX:
   - Ctrl+Shift+P → "Extensions: Install from VSIX"
   - Select: extension/sandbox-switcher-0.1.0.vsix

4. Reload again

5. Test:
   - Ctrl+Shift+Y (Sync Now) should now work
   - You should see "Sandbox sync completed successfully"

Version:
--------
This fix is included in sandbox-switcher-0.1.0.vsix dated 2025-10-20.

The extension now properly handles:
- Paths with spaces (Windows OneDrive paths)
- Binary paths with spaces
- Exclude patterns with spaces
